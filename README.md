- 🎶 **Play Music**: Access a music library and play your favorite tunes.
- 🔍 **Search and Information**: Get quick answers to any question using Gemini AI.
- 🤖 **Smart Assistant**: Works like **Alexa** or **Google Assistant**.

### Technologies Used:
- **Python** 🐍
- **Google Gemini API** 🌐
- **Speech Recognition** 🗣️
- **gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)** 🔊
- **pygame** 🎮
- **Pydantic** ⚙️
- **gTTS** for text-to-speech conversion 🎤
  
This project brings together **AI**, **voice processing**, and **cloud integration** to create a truly smart assistant. ✨
